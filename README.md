# DailyTaskLog
- This project is a dynamic workday scheduler that leverages JavaScript, jQuery, and the Day.js library to create an interactive calendar. The scheduler displays the current day with proper date suffixes and features color-coded time blocks for past, present, and future hours. Users can input and save tasks for each hour, and the events persist between page reloads using local storage.

To add a task, begin typing in the text area beside the corresponding time. Afterward, click the save button on the right. A pop-up will appear on your screen, confirming that your task has been successfully saved and added to the localStorage.

The saved tasks will persist in the scheduler even after refreshing the browser. The scheduler features three shades of pink: light pink represents past hours, dark pink corresponds to the current hour, and intermediate pink indicates future tasks.
